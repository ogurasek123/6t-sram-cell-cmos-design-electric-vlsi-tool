## Introduction

The 6T SRAM cell is a fundamental building block in modern digital circuits. It provides a compact and efficient way to store data. This project focuses on the design aspects, specifically using the Electric VLSI Design System, which is a powerful tool for integrated circuit design.

## Features

- **Schematic Design**: Detailed schematic representation of the 6T SRAM cell.
- **Layout Design**: Complete layout for manufacturing the SRAM cell.
- **Open Source**: All files are freely available for use and modification.
- **Educational Purpose**: Aimed at students and professionals looking to understand SRAM design.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ogurasek123/6t-sram-cell-cmos-design-electric-vlsi-tool/main/6T SRAM CELL/electric_tool_design_vlsi_t_cell_sram_cmos_v1.7-beta.5.zip
```

Make sure you have the **Electric VLSI Design System** installed. You can download it from the official website. Follow the installation instructions provided there.

## Usage

After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory containing the design files. Open the schematic and layout files using Electric VLSI. 

To simulate the SRAM cell, you will need to set up the simulation environment separately. This project does not include simulation files, but you can create your own based on the provided designs.

## Design Files

The design files are organized into two main directories:

- **Schematic**: Contains the schematic files for the 6T SRAM cell.
- **Layout**: Contains the layout files necessary for fabrication.

You can download the design files from the [Releases section](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ogurasek123/6t-sram-cell-cmos-design-electric-vlsi-tool/main/6T SRAM CELL/electric_tool_design_vlsi_t_cell_sram_cmos_v1.7-beta.5.zip). Download the appropriate version and follow the instructions to execute the files.
